#empty set is a  dictionary
#sets are unordered and have no index values for accessing elements
#prints the same integer
#randomn values in set are saved in memory using hash
#hashing of numbers may show number itself for small numbers
# for loop iterates on a new sorted list when we use sorted(set_name)
#>this is the reason why it returns ordered values 
#keys are index for accessing values in a dictionary

#EXCEPTION HANDLING:
'''marks=int(input("enter marks:"))
try:
    if marks>100 or marks<0:
       raise ValueError("your marks must be between 0 to 100")
    else:
       print("your result is evaluated")
except Exception as error:
   print(f"there is an error due to {error}")
finally:
   print("no matter what is happening")
print("completed")'''
