# Lead Classification Engine

A Python-based automation tool designed to qualify business leads instantly. This script helps enterprises and agencies prioritize their outreach by categorizing leads based on budget and interest levels.

##  Problem Solved
Sales teams often waste hours talking to "Cold" leads. This script automates the qualification process, ensuring that high-potential ("Hot") leads are identified the moment their data is entered.

##  Logic & Criteria
I have built this using Rule-Based Logic:
- Hot Lead: High interest (user-defined) + Budget > ₹50,000.
- Warm Lead: Medium interest oe budget between ₹20,000 - ₹50,000.
- Cold Lead: Low interest and low budget.

## Tech Stack
- Language: Python 
- Concepts Used: Functions,Conditional Branching, User Input/output and Using for loop.

##  Future Roadmap (Coming Soon)
- [ ] Integration with Google Sheets API.
- [ ] Automated Email Notifications for Hot Leads.
- [ ] Data persistence using CSV/Excel.
